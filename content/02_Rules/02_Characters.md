Mit ihrem Charakter beeinflussen und gestalten die Spieler das Setting und ins­besondere das Abenteuer. Jeder Spieler führt seinen Charakter durch das Aben­teuer, beschreibt seine Handlungen und spricht für ihn.

Der Charakter und seine Gruppe spielen eine wichtige Rolle im Setting und diezentralen Rollen in jedem Abenteuer, das sie erleben. Also versuche einen be­sonderen Charakter zu erschaffen.

Jeder Spieler erschafft sich seinen eigenen Charakter. Die Charaktere bilden eine Gruppe und sollten daher auch gemeinsam erschaffen werden. Die Spieler kön­nen sich dadurch untereinander absprechen, so dass eine Gruppe entsteht, deren Charaktere sich gegenseitig ergänzen. Aber natürlich kontrolliert jeder Spielerseinen Charakter selbständig.

Erschaffe also einen gruppenfähigen Charakter, keinen Einzelgänger, der ständig die Handlungen der Gruppe sabotiert. Wieso sollte eine Gruppe so jemandenintegrieren? Er darf Ecken und Kanten besitzen, solange sie den Charakter interessanter gestalten und ihn nicht ihn zum Verhinderer machen

### Overview of character creation:

**Character attributes**:

1. 12 points are distributed accross the 4 profiles, but at least 1 point for each. Each profile can at maximum only be 2 points higher than the next lowest one. If the setting defines magic categories, 1 point can be put towards a magic category.
2. Apply species / faction bonuses (if defined in the setting).
3. Each character starts with 5 adventure points and zero experience points.

**Background**:

4. Decide name and background
5. Define two traits

**Equipment**:

6. Buy equipment worth a total of two bonus points.
7. Collect 100 [CU](../Glossary.md#CU) in starter money.

# Character attributes

## Profiles

The skills of the character are defined through four profiles. The names of these profiles and which skills they contain are defined by the setting.

The higher the profile value, the better the character is using the skills in the respective area of expertise. The profile value determines how many dice are rolled during a conflict.

At character creation 12 points can be distributed accorss the profiles. Each profile must get at least one point and no profile must be better than 2 points compared to the next lowest.

---

**Possible profile values**

| Mundane    | Magic user |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 1, 2, 4, 5 | 1, 2, 4, 4 |
| 1, 3, 3, 5 | 1, 3, 3, 4 |
| 2, 2, 3, 5 | 2, 2, 3, 4 |
| 2, 2, 4, 4 | 2, 3, 3, 3 |
| 3, 3, 3, 3 |            |

## Magic categories

If the setting defines magic categories, the player can allocate one point to a magic category to create a magic using character. Magic follows the same rule as equipment; the points allocated to the respective magic category thus grants the same bonus in all conflicts in which magic is utilized.

## Species- and faction bonuses

If the setting defines species and or faction bonuses, they are added to the profile values. This can allow a profile to be more 3 points better than the next lowest.

### Tip: Don't create a one-track specialist

Create a character who can survive on their own. Not a one-track specialist who can only add to one or two scenes per adventure. Because you as a player must be capable of progressing the adventure, and you probably don't want play only a spectator.

---

---

### Example for profile allocation

Willi decides to, in concert with his group, to play an intellectual character who can also survive in the wilderness. "Pulp" has the profiles of Scientist, Pioneer, Soldier and Crook. Willy allocates his points as follows: Scientist 5, Pioneer 4, Soldier 2, Crook 1.

---

## Toughness

Besides it's value each profile also has a toughness of 6 points, unless the setting gives a different default. The toughness can be reduced during a conflict, but not below 0. Is the toughness of a profile reaches 0, the character suffers a consequence. Toughness only regenerates through the expenditure of adventure points or at the start of a new adventure.

## Consequences

Consequnces are disadvantages affecting the character which must be played out, but do not influence any of the rule mechanics. There are no consequences at character creation. Consequences are acquired within an adventure when the toughness of a profile reaches zero. They apply to the character until they are cleared through level up.

## Adventure points

Adventure points are resources which the player can spend at any point. Which adventure points you can:

- Increase the dicepool by 2 dice per point
- Regenerate the toughness of a profile by 3 points
- Buy important facts (from the GM)

At character creation each character gets 5 adventure poins. These will reset at the beginning of each adventure. During an adventure the game master will give out fresh adventure points for particularly well played character scenes.

## Experience points

Each character starts at level one with zero experience points. Experience points can be collected by living through an adventure. Their purpose is to make the character better over time.

# Background

The background gives the character individuality. Besides names, appearance and demeanour there are interests and past events. The choice of writing the background out in prose or noting it down in a rough outline is personal preference.

---

### Tips for backgrounds

Create a background that makes your character interesting. Characters with a mind of their own and some flaws can enrich the game.

A cool background doesn't do anything if it is overshadowed in the game. So make your background useful. First for yourself, so that you can play it out better and secondly for your group and game master so that they have a hook to play with your character.

Tropes are wonderful, everyone knows them and one quickly develops a mental picture. So utilize tropes to give your character typical or atypical traits.

---

The following questions can help to address the most important facts about the character background:

1. **Appearance**
   How does the character look and how do they dress?
   How old is your character and where were they born?
   Which details give them an individual touch?

2. **Behavior**
   What is their standing with the group?
   How do they behave towards their friends?
   What is their current social standing?

3. **History**
   What did they do before joining the group?
   Have they learned a profession?
   What motivates them?

---

### Example backstory

Willi calls his character James Montgomery, he's from England and 30 years old. He answers the background question as follows:

1. Somewhat longer, brown hair and a full beard. He wears a corduroy suit.
2. Montgomery is a curious and typically formal englishman.
3. He was professor of archeology at cambridge university, grew tired of the classroom and now wants to see the world.

---

## Traits

Part of the character background in Lite are two traits. These are meant to bringe some individuality to your character, bring some flavor to the game and give players the opportunity to earn adventure points. Traits can be either positive or negative features and behavior patterns. Nothing is more boring than a sleek chracter without any rough edges and flaws. The traits ideally play off the characters background.

Each character should have two traits and the player has the freedom to invent any they like. Traits can be replaced or dropped, if you find out during the game that they don't fit the character you want to play.

---

### Tip: Good traits

Good traits don't have to be positive for the character. Much more important is that they can be actively brought up by you or other players during the game, which allows you to earn adventure points. A good trait gives your character an image and makes them memorable. So don't use the traits to make your character as strong as possible, but to make them as interesting as possible for everyone at the table.

---

---

### Example traits

Willi gives James the following two traits:

1. Can be naive and curious.
2. Can't stomach seeing blood.

# Equipment

Equipment are those possessions of the character, which are relevant for the adventure or in support of the personality of the character. In a tough as nails pulp setting, the latest model gramophone is thus doesn't belong on the equipment list - but the shotgun does.

If an item is used during a conflict, it's bonus temporarily increases the value or toughness of a profile. The effectivness dictates how effective an item is, which for a weapon is comparable to it's damage.

At character creation the chracter can be given any number of items, without any regard for the costs. Small details must be noted on the character sheet. The chosen equipment should fit the background of the character. A poor archeology professor wouldn't drive a Ferrari.

The equipment can be chosen from the equipment list of the setting or - in deliberation with the game master - generated as needed.

After the equipment is chose, they have to be assigned values. Each item has a profile bonus of 0, a toughness bonus of 0 and an effectiveness of 1.

There are 2 points to distribute [per character]. Each point either gives +1 on toughness or profile value. Alternatively both points can be used to increase the effectiveness of an item. More effective items cause a higher loss of toughness in conflicts.

| **Notation of equipment values**                |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| The bonuses are noted directly after each item. |
| **P** stands for profile bonus.                 |
| **T** stands for toughness bonus.               |
| **E** for the effectivness.                     |


| **Example: Equipment**      |
|-----------------------------|
| Willing is browsing the equipment list for *Pulp* and picks a shotgun and a survival kit. He generates his own custom item in form of an archeology kit. The two bonus points he splits as follows: |
| Shotgun P+1, T+0, E 1       |
| Survival kit P+1, T+0, E 1  |


## Starting money

Each character starts their adventuring career with 100 CU (currency units), unless the setting states otherwise.
