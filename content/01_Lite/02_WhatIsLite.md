# What is Lite?

Lite is a pen and paper roleplaying game. Such a game revolves around experiencing and creating an fictional adventure together, of which nobody knows what exactly will happen. Thus creativity, imagination, spontanity and improvisaional skills of everyone involved are tested.

## Adventure

The adventure is played in a group selected setting, which sets the grenre and quirks of the game world (e.g. a fantasy world with magic). Lite is not constrained to any particular setting.

The events of the adventure are depicted at the gaming table through description, direct speech and drawings. Conflicts in the adventure are resolved through the skills of the characters and dice.

## Roles

Lite has two distinct roles, which the participants must take up: One game master and 3 to 6 players.

### The players

Each player plays one character, which is a member of the adventuring group. The player describes the actions of their character, their behavior and speaks for them through direct speech. The characters are created by the group before starting the adventure, adhering to Lites rules. By experiencing adventures characters gain experience and can improve themselves.

### The game master

The game master plays all the characters in the adventure that are not played by players and describes the events of the game and the environments the characters find themselves in.

The game master prepares the adventure, either by reading up on a pre-made one or writing their own. They often play out the enemies of the characters, but that does not make them the enemy of the players. Rather, the players and the game master work together to achieve the best possible game experience for the whole group.

## Rules

Lite focuses more on the narrative aspects than tactical procedure. The rules of Lite aim to be as simple and flexible as possible.
