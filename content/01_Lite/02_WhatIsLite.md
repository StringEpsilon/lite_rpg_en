# What is Lite?

Lite is a pen and paper roleplaying game. Such a game revolves around experiencing and creating an fictional adventure together, of which nobody knows what exactly will happen. Thus creativity, imagination, spontanity and improvisaional skills of everyone involved are tested.

## Adventure

The adventure is played in a group selected setting, which sets the grenre and quirks of the game world (e.g. a fantasy world with magic). Lite is not constrained to any particular setting.

The events of the adventure are depicted at the gaming table through description, direct speech and drawings. Conflicts in the adventure are resolved through the skills of the characters and dice.

## Roles

Lite has two distinct roles, which the participants must take up: One game master and 3 to 6 players.

### The players

Each player plays one character, which is a member of the adventuring group. The player describes the actions of their character, their behavior and speaks for them through direct speech. The characters are created by the group before starting the adventure, adhering to Lites rules. By experiencing adventures characters gain experience and can improve themselves.

### The game master

The game master plays all the characters in the adventure that are not played by players and describes the events of the game and the environments the characters find themselves in.

The game master prepares the adventure, either by reading up on a pre-made one or writing their own. They often play out the enemies of the characters, but that does not make them the enemy of the players. Rather, the players and the game master work together to achieve the best possible game experience for the whole group.

## Rules

Lite focuses more on the narrative aspects than tactical procedure. The rules of Lite aim to be as simple and flexible as possible.

### Characters

The skills of the characters are described by four profiles, which have numerical values. The higher these values, the better the character is. The names of the profiles are prescribed by the setting. The character is also defined by player created traits, potentially magic categories (depending on the setting) and equipment.

### Conflict resolution

Lite uses a unified approach to all kinds of conflicts from trading over bar fights to space battles. Conflicts are resolved through dice rolls. The number of dice depends on the profile value and equipment. Each die has a 50% chance of success (even number). How many successes are needed depends on the opponent and or difficulty of the action. Each conflict is decided via a diceroll of each participant and for important conflicts the details are jointly narrated afterwards, where each success stands for a positive aspect and each miss for a negative one.
