## Adventure points (Gummipunkte)

The original german term is an idiomatic term describing useless or vague "points" one might be awarded by a friend. Like to [Brownie points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_points), but more ironic. "Gummipunkte" allegedly found it's way into "Lite" because it was used as a (humerous) umbrella term for a variety of different game mechanics such as Bennies, Fate-Points, etc on the Tanelorn forums.
