| Gummipunkte   | adventure points | "Gummipunkte" is very hard to translate properly. Adventure points captures what they are, but not the lighthearted nature of the original term.                               |
| Normal        | Mundane          | "Normal" as it refers to non-magical characters.                                                                                                                               |

| Rasse         | Species          | "Race" would be the usual common term, but "species" more accurately portrays what these usually are: Distinct species of sentient beings, not arbitrary subgroups within one. |
| Völker        | Faction          | I chose "faction" to make it more setting neutral. "People" would be a more accurate translation.                                                                              |
